## About the program:
The Sparse program will take an input file, which contains all the information required to create the appropriate matrices, to create them. Out of this file, two matrices with *n* entries are created. The two matrices created will be printed out, then it will do a couple of arithmetic operations with them such as multiplying, adding, subtracting and as well as transposing.

## Program usage: 
 - 1. make Sparse
 - 2. ./Sparse (input file) (output file)

## Files included:
 - Sparse.c (Contains the main() program to create a matrix and manipulate them.)
 - List.c (Contains full implementation for a Doubly Linked List.)
 - List.h (header file for List.c)
 - Matrix.c (Contains full implementation for a Matrix ADT.)
 - Matrix.h (header file for Matrix.c)
 - MatrixTest.c (A program to test functionality for Matrix.c)
 - ListTest.c (A program to test functionality of List.c)
 - Makefile (to compile any included files.)
