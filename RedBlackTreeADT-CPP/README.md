## About the program:
The Order.cpp file will take an input file contains a list of words, sort them based on alphabetical order and also the in order in which they were found using a BST structure. The results will then be put into an output file. 
The WordFrequency.cpp file will take an input file containing a text of words, and parse each and every word, and determine how frequently the word appears. To keep track of all word frequencies, they are stored in a RBT. All the words with their frequencies will be stored in the outfile.

## Program usage: 
 - 1. make 
 - 2. ./Order (input file) (output file)
 - 3. ./WordFrequency (input file) (output file)

## Files included:
 - Order.cpp (Contains the main() to implement the sorting operations.)
 - WordFrequency.cpp (Contains the main() to implement word frequency operations.)
 - Dictionary.cpp (Contains all the classes and methods needed to implement a BST.)
 - Dictionary.h (header file for Dictionary.cpp)
 - DictionaryTest.cpp (A program to test functionality of the RBT)
 - Makefile (to compile any included files.)
 - README (this file.)
