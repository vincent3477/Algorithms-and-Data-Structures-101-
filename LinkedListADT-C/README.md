## About the program:
This program will sort all the words from a file by alphabetical order and output the sorted words to another file. The words are sorted via a List, which contains all the indexes of each of the words based on the order in the input file. The underlying data structure for the List ADT is a Doubly Linked List.

## Program usage: 
 - 1. make
 - 2. ./Lex (input file) (output file)

## Files included:
 - Lex.c (Implementation to sorted the words from a input file by alphabetical order.)
 - List.c (Contains full implementation for a Doubly Linked List.)
 - List.h (header file for List.c)
 - ListTest.c (A program to test functionality for List.c)
 - Makefile (to compliling everything)
 - README (this file.)
