## About the program:
The Shuffle.cpp program will take an int from stdin. For each number of decks up until int (inclusive), create a list in ascending order from 1 until deck number. Shuffle once. Shuffle again and again until the list is in the same order again. The output will be the number of decks, and right next to it being the number of shuffles it took.

## Program usage: 
 - 1. make Shuffle
 - 2. ./Shuffle (int)
